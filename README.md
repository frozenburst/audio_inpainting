# SLAIN - Audio Inpainting With Conditional GAN

This works is under review right now.
Paper with details might be available in the future.


1. git clone repo
2. cd audio_inpainting
3. git submodule updata --init

## Description

1. The repo is not well organized right now, but should be available for training and inference.
2. All the hyperparameters are written in the train.py, just for easily developement in personal project.
3. If the hyperparameters are set correctly, should be able to run "python train.py". The details to run the project might be available if need.
4. Those scripts to deal with data are in directory scripts, plz follow the usage in codes.
5. I provide the checkpoints for Esc-50 and the Maestro below.
